# Automate-Moderator-Addition-in-Hackerrank-Challenge-using-puppeteer-in-NodeJS

A script written in JavaScript which automates the process of adding moderators on any given challenge(s), which can feel to be redundant and boring work when done manually by any person going to every challenge in various (maybe 1000s) challenges and adding moderator(s). This JS script uses NodeJS puppeteer library to perform its tasks.
